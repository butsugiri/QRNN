## About
Re-implementation of Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN) by Chainer.

The original paper is:
>James Bradbury, Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, and Richard Socher. 2016. [Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576)

The original implementation of QRNN (which is also written in Chainer) is publicly available on this [blog post](https://metamind.io/research/new-neural-network-building-block-allows-faster-and-more-accurate-text-understanding/). However, the author only provides so-called "core" implementation, which is only a chunk of code.

Instead, this repository aims to offer full-implementation of QRNN.

## Implementation Details
### What is included
* QRNN with fo-pooling architecture (`bin/QRNNLM/net/model.py`)
* Scripts for language modeling experiment (`bin/QRNNLM/train_qrnn.py`)

### What is not included
* QRNN Encoder-Decoder model

## Dependencies
* Python 3.5
* Chainer 1.21.0

## How to run
1. Download preprocessed version of Penn Tree Bank from [here](http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/Ëœimikolov/rnnlm/simple-examples.tgz).
2. Create `data/ptb` directory at the same level as `bin` and copy downloaded data (`train.txt` `valid.txt` `test.txt`) in it.
2. Train the model: `python train_qrnn.py --gpu <gpu_id> --epoch 100 --dim 640 --batchsize 20 --bproplen 105 --unit 640 --decay 0.0002`
3. For computing the perplexity for the test set, use `eval_qrnn.py`

## Result
TBA
