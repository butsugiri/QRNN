# QRNN
Re-implementation of Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNN) by Chainer.

The original paper is:
>James Bradbury, Stephen Merity, Caiming Xiong, and Richard Socher. 2016. [Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576)

The original implementation of QRNN (also written in Chainer) is publicly available on this [blog post](https://metamind.io/research/new-neural-network-building-block-allows-faster-and-more-accurate-text-understanding/). However, the author only provides so-called "core" implementation, which is not runnable by itselfï¼Ž

Thus, this repository aims to offer full-implementation of QRNN.
